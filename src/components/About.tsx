          <p>
            I'm a self-taught web developer, currently learning front-end
            development with React. I like to teach myself anything that catches
            my interest (like web development!).
          </p>
          <p>
            After I have a bigger knowledge about web development (front and
            back end), I wish to learn about 3D design and animations, maybe
            even game development. I also wish to learn about automotive
            mechanics.
          </p>
          <p>My biggest interests are cars ðŸš˜ and coffee â˜•</p>
          <p>Hope you find this little website enjoyable!</p>
