          <h3>Why can't I post anything?</h3>
          <p>
            You cannot post because, only my account can post any type of
            information. That is to reduce the size the database would take,
            instead you can have a look at the posts I made.
          </p>
          <h3>Why is the website so familiar?</h3>
          <p>That's easy! Because I took inspiration from DEV.to</p>
          <h3>Why didn't you use Forem to build the website?</h3>
          <p>
            Even though DEV.to is built with Forem, my objective is to learn web
            development, and not just use platforms like Forem to build a
            website, also it's not as "fun" as building the website from
            scratch.

          <h3>Source code? ðŸ‘€</h3>
          <p>
            Sure!{" "}
